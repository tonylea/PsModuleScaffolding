### Export-NUnitXml

The Export-NUnitXml helper function was 90% the work of [Mathieu Buisson][1]. The original [code][2] was updated to work on PowerShell Core and non-windows systems, but otherwise it's unchanged.

### PSScriptAnalyzer NUnit Tests

Again, this is work of [Mathieu Buisson][1]. He explains how it works in his blog post, [Making PSScriptAnalyzer a first-class citizen in a PowerShell CI pipeline][3]. It was written in 2016, but still holds true.
